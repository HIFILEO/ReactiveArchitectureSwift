### AlamofireObjectMapper

AlamofireObjectMapper was chosen as a fast way to ingest API data from the movie database API. However this choice comes at a
cost in a production app where the app will likely crash when the API is in a format we don't expect. As per a PR from

From "Max Clarke"
"If data comes back from the API in a format we don't expect, the app will likely crash. The code is force unwrapping deserialised
API response model vars all over the place. This is a failure of AlamofireObjectMapper where you have to make all vars optional.
We moved away from this to the built in swift 4 Codable protocol. This is much nicer, you can use immutable non-optionals.
Your init is throwable, so if something doesn't decode from json as you'd expect an error is thrown for you to handle.
You can then just filter that model out etc."
